A real-time sign language interpreter that can translate Arabic sign language into the written language to be displayed to the user as a text stream. (Using neural networks and other machine learning algorithms).

In this project, our aim is to translate sign language into Arabic text, so we decided to use the ResNet cnn architecture. We tried several architectures of ResNet, that are the following: ResNet50, ResNet18, and ResNet10, as you can see from the uploaded file, all of these have similar accuracies, but ResNet50 resulted in an overfit, while ResNet10 resulted in an underfit, so we used ResNet18 that gave us the best results.
